# THIS DOES NOT WORK YET

#### Very Simple Desktop Manager

what is this for?
people who want the absolute minimum for their desktop management,
this program is not and will not be optimized for LOC,
but it will be optimized for readability and reliability,
thing this program will not have are
* 1.user login (this is intended to do as little as possible, use agetty login)
* 2.proper GUI (i might do TUI, but unless theres a hyper minimal DRM option, no GUI)

this project uses the [black formater](https://github.com/psf/black) 
and depends on bash, and (optionally) startx (needed for x11 desktops), hopefully i can 
figure out xinit to not rely on startx though
